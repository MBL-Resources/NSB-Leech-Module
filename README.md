# NS&B Leech Module

In this module of the Neural Systems & Behavior course at the MBL, all of the students work on the leech as an experimental system. Students learn neurophysiology and neuroanatomical techniques. Techniques include intracellular electrophysiological recordings in current clamp and voltage clamp configuration, extracellular recordings, and intracellular dye injection, and MATLAB instruction. The goal is to identify neurons by their electrophysiological properties and learn about their electrical and chemical interactions. Towards the end of the cycle students work in pairs on individual research projects that they design.
